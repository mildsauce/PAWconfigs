Privileged Access Workstation Configurations for Windows 

WindowsFirewallPolicy.wfw
Deny inboud/outbound traffic by default. You must create rules using executable path names, ports/protocols,
local and remote host IP addresses. Download this wfw file and import into your local or GPO firewall. 
This will be a template to build from based on executable path names. You should add local and remote host
IP addresses for additional control.
